1. Cannot connect to mongodb after restart your computer

This happened probably because the MongoDB service isn't started. Follow the below steps to start it:

1. Go to Control Panel and click on Administrative Tools.
2. Double click on Services. A new window opens up.
3. Search MongoDB.exe. Right click on it and select Start.
